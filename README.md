# Car-Rental-System

This is the project for a Car Rental System program in C++, where the customer can register, login, book a car and see the bill of the booked car of the customer. The admin of
the program can add a car, view reservations of the car, and hold the records of all previous bookings. An additional file is created to see the previous bookings of the same   
customer, which can be viewed by the customer who has logged in.
